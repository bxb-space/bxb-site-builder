### Proposal  

> The BxB project addresses outstanding questions at the heart of two rapidly advancing fields of astrophysics and cosmology: Galactic magnetism and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization.  
>Research is funded by the French national science foundation (Agence National de la Recherche, ANR).  

Magnetism represents a fascinating, and so far poorly understood, facet of our cosmic origins. In the past few years, cosmic magnetism has become a recognized and rapidly growing field of research in astrophysics. This evolution was made possible by major improvements in observational capabilities.
